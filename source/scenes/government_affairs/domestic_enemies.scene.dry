= Investigating Domestic Enemies

As we have control over the Interior Ministry, we can direct police and intelligence services to investigate internal enemies. We can proscribe various organizations.

- @ban_sa: Ban the SA.
- @unban_sa: Unban the SA.
- @persecute_sa
- @ban_sh: Ban the Stahlhelm.
- @unban_sh: Unban the Stahlhelm.
- @persecute_sh
- @ban_wul: Ban the Communist WUL.
- @unban_wul: Unban the WUL.
- @persecute_wul
- @root: Take no action for now.

@ban_sa
view-if: scp_urgency >= 3 and sa_banned == 0
on-arrival: sa_strength *= 0.85; sa_strength *= 0.7 if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7; sa_banned = 1; cpc_relation -= 3; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.05; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05; sa_militancy -= 0.05; sa_ban_timer = 6;

As it turns out, the SCPs SA has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the SA can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7 : Nevertheless, the SA is substantially weakened by our ban. ?]

@unban_sa
view-if: sa_banned = 1
on-arrival: sa_banned = 0; sa_strength += 100; sa_militancy += 0.05

The SA is no longer banned. They immediately go on a recruiting spree.

@persecute_sa
title: Further persecute the SA.
view-if: sa_banned = 1
choose-if: judicial_reform >= 3 and interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7
unavailable-subtitle: [? if judicial_reform < 3 : The judiciary would not allow this. ?] [? if interior_police_loyalty < 0.7 : The police are too disloyal to be trusted with this. ?]
on-arrival: sa_strength *= 0.7; sa_militancy -= 0.05

We have arrested more of the SA's leaders and confiscated their weapons.

@ban_sh
on-arrival: sh_strength *= 0.85; sh_strength *= 0.7 if interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7; sh_banned = 1; cpc_relation -= 5; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.1; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05; coalition_dissent += 1 if flg_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and monarch = "George V"; sh_ban_timer = 6;
view-if: sh_banned == 0

[? if monarch == "George V": Banning the Stahlhelm weakens our relationship with Monarch George V, as well as the political right and the police. ?][? if monarch != "George V": Banning the Stahlhelm weakens our relationship with the political right and the police. ?] [? if flg_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and monarch = "George V" : It also weakens our coalition due to the influence of George V on the right wing of our coalition. ?] In addition, the Stahlhelm still operates out of public sight.

@unban_sh
view-if: sh_banned = 1
on-arrival: sh_banned = 0; sh_strength += 100

The Stahlhelm is no longer banned.

@persecute_sh

view-if: sh_banned = 1
choose-if: judicial_reform >= 4 and interior_police_loyalty >= 0.7
unavailable-subtitle: [? if judicial_reform < 4 : The judiciary would not allow this. ?] [? if interior_police_loyalty < 0.7 : The police are too disloyal to be trusted with this. ?]
on-arrival: sh_strength *= 0.7; sh_militancy -= 0.05; cpc_relation -= 5; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.1; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05; coalition_dissent += 1 if flg_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and monarch = "George V";

We have arrested more of the Stahlhelm's leaders and confiscated their weapons.

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The Communists take this as one more reason why the Socialists are traitors to the left. However, the moderate and center-right parties approve, as do the police.

@unban_wul
view-if: wul_banned = 1
on-arrival: wul_banned = 0; cp_relation += 5; wul_strength += 50; prussian_police_loyalty -= 0.05; interior_police_loyalty -= 0.05

The Communist WUL is no longer banned.

@persecute_wul

view-if: wul_banned = 1
on-arrival: wul_strength *= 0.7; wul_militancy -= 0.05; cp_relation -= 10; cp_coalition_dissent += 1; rpc_relation += 5; cpc_relation += 5; prussian_police_loyalty += 0.1; interior_police_loyalty += 0.1; coalition_dissent -= 1 if coalition_dissent > 0 and n_wul_persecuted = 0; n_wul_persecuted += 1

We have arrested more of the WUL's leaders and confiscated their weapons.
